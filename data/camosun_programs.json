Learn how to plan, design, and maintain structures and public works, while respecting and responding to the natural environment.Is Civil Engineering Technology right for you?While trial and error may work when building your own marble run, it won’t work if you’re designing a bridge. The calculation of all the forces and stresses needs to occur before anything is built and these calculations require some pretty complex math. Furthermore, a much-overlooked talent necessary in engineering is communication. Drawings, reports, site meetings, instructions to contractors, even emails and phone conversations all require communication skills. The best engineers and technologists have skills in both areas.As a Civil Engineering Technologist, you'll have the opportunity to work on:bridges, buildings, towers, silos and tunnelshighways, roads, railroads, airports and canalsprotection of the environment and public health by treating water and sewage, and by protecting our streams and waterways from urban runoffstructures and subdivisionsinfrastructure such as water supply, water mains, sewer mains and flood control\n\t Civil Engineering Technology Info In demandObtaining a Diploma in Civil Engineering Technology is one of the quickest paths to a rewarding and well-paying career.

    "overview": "Fascinating, complicated and complex\n      Start in SeptemberThe Diploma in Criminal Justice program provides a social justice perspective on criminal justice systems and processes that form the foundation for ethical, responsible, and professional practice in the criminal justice field. This applied program incorporates classroom and community learning experiences, and theoretical frameworks to explore topics including the interagency working of police, courts, corrections, and social service agencies; the impacts of colonization and the resulting intergenerational trauma of Indigenous Peoples, and a critical understanding and social justice approach to current challenges in modern society.Located at our Lansdowne campus, the Criminal Justice program is two years long, with an optional internship. A core curriculum forms the foundation for the first year of studies; in the second year you can choose which stream of courses best meets your professional and academic goals.Graduate and enter directly into the criminal justice field. Or transfer your courses and enter into year-three of a bachelor’s degree program.In demandThere are over 500,000 criminal justice-related jobs in Canada. Upon receiving your two-year diploma, you’ll be ready for entry-level positions in correctional services, customs, law enforcement, and services to young offenders.If you continue on to complete a bachelor’s degree in Criminology, you’ll be eligible for additional employment opportunities in such fields as probation, parole, immigration, research, and counselling within institutions.A great student experience\"Camosun was definitely a good stepping stone for me to continue on to university. The knowledge I received while there has provided me with a problem-free transition to the learning I am currently receiving in third year at the University of Ottawa. With small class sizes, it is easy to build solid relationships with professors, and it has been a push in the right direction for a career in the CJS. A positive experience in every aspect.\"Tanner Northrup\"I have nothing but good things to say about Camosun College. My teachers were always open for discussion, knew me by name, and always encouraged me to excel and aim for higher goals. The high standard for academic excellence within the Criminal Justice program allowed me to make an easy transition from Camosun to the University of Ottawa, where I continue my studies.\"Carmelle Churchill\"I recommend the Criminal Justice program at Camosun for anyone pursuing a career or further education in the field of criminology.The material is well taught, well organized, and very relevant for practical applications and in academia. The bureaucracy of the program is organized to be conducive for first-time students, relieving student stress during course selection and eventually diploma application. Most classes are fairly small; there is a lot of student-professor interaction and professors are very available. An active Criminal Justice Undergrad Society adds to a fun and friendly atmosphere leading to excellent peer resources in time for finals. Even years after graduation and across great distances, I am still in regular contact with dozens of Camosun alumni who are likely to be life-long friends. Camosun is definitely the best school I ever attended.\"Jonathon Ranney\"I finished the Criminal Justice program and have since received my BA in Criminology from SFU and am currently attending law school at UBC. Camosun's Criminal Justice program provided a great foundation for my education. The teaching staff had varied experiences, and Victoria provided a great backdrop to assess the many career options available with a criminal justice degree. I am very thankful I chose Camosun College.\"Catherine Beston",

An online option of the Information Session is available for anyone unable to attend in personAfter the document submission deadline, all qualified applicants receive registration and scheduling instructions for their non-academic assessment. This assessment will be the CASPer test (Computer-Based Assessment for Sampling Personal Characteristics). CASPer is an open-response situational judgment test that measures aspects of your social intelligence and professionalism, like ethics, empathy, problem-solving and collaboration. Students may take the assessment one time per application cycle and must do so within the prescribed timeframe indicated by the program; Students applying to other Allied Health & Technologies programs at Camosun College need only take the assessment once per application cycleAdmissions Process:The rigour of this program requires students to have a high level of commitment and preparedness to be successful. In order to serve students best, admission processes for many Allied Health programs in British Columbia and across Canada include a selection process whereby applicants are selected, or compete for program entry. The program ranks students according to academic preparedness and non-academic qualities including situational judgement, proven to be reliable predictors of personal commitment and future professional behaviours. Applicants with the highest overall rankings are offered seats in the program. This process enhances students’ likelihood of program success and future employability.Once all applicants have completed the non-academic assessment, the program calculates an aggregate score for each applicant by equally weighting the academic (combined GPA of admission requirements) and non-academic assessment scores (indicators of program and future professional success) to determine which applicants will receive program seat invitations. Once all aggregated scores are totalled, the students selected will be offered seats in the program for a given year, pending completion of the Program Participation Requirements prior to the program start date.The program maintains a short waitlist for late entry into the same year due to student withdrawals or deferrals. Waitlists are not retained for future years. Those applicants meeting the admission requirements, but not gaining a seat in the year of application need to reapply in order to be eligible in a subsequent year.\n\t Ready to get started?

CASPer is an open-response situational judgment test that measures aspects of your social intelligence and professionalism, like ethics, empathy, problem-solving and collaboration. Students may take the assessment one time per application cycle and must do so within the prescribed timeframe indicated by the program. Students applying to other Allied Health & Technologies programs at Camosun College need only take the assessment once per application cycle.Admissions ProcessThe rigor of this program requires students to have a high level of commitment and preparedness to be successful. In order to serve students best, admission processes for many Allied Health programs in British Columbia and across Canada include a selection process whereby applicants are selected, or compete for program entry. The program ranks students according to academic preparedness and non-academic qualities including situational judgement, proven to be reliable predictors of personal commitment and future professional behaviours. Applicants with the highest overall rankings are offered seats in the program. This process enhances students' likelihood of program success and future employability.All academic application requirements must be completed within the previous five years.Once all applicants have completed the non-academic assessment, the program calculates an aggregate score for each applicant by equally weighting the academic (combined GPA of admission requirements) and non-academic assessment scores (indicators of program and future professional success) to determine which applicants will receive program seat invitations. Once all aggregated scores are totaled, the students selected will be offered seats in the program for a given year, pending completion of the Program Participation Requirements prior to the program start date.The program maintains a short waitlist for late entry into the same year due to student withdrawals or deferrals. Waitlists are not retained for future years. Those applicants meeting the admission requirements, but not gaining a seat in the year of application need to reapply in order to be eligible in a subsequent year.When you apply you will need to submit proof that you meet the program admission requirements listed above. Where a letter grade is specified, you must have proof of that grade or higher.\n          For more details, including courses, please see the program outline in the Academic Calendar: Loading...Ready to get started?Applications for the Fall semester open on Sept. 15 with a deadline of Dec. 15.Apply nowCheck our current program availability.Missing admission requirements?You may be able to take an assessment or upgrade with us.Need help applying?Find out more on How to Apply or speak to an Admissions Advisor.",
